# Release Notes v3.2.0 24/06/2021

Addition of analogWrite features for ESP32 targets. This requires upgarde to [PMB Tools](https://github.com/philbowles/pmbtools) 0.5.0 

``H4P_ToneController`` now compiles for ESP32, with the limotation of two independent voices. Minot changes have been made also to ``H4P_Signaller`` in relation to API ``throbPin()`` This has changed and now gives sinusoidal in/out glow. The ``valley`` parameter has been removed.

Example sketches [H4P_GymnopedieNo1](../examples/MUSIC/H4P_GymnopedieNo1/H4P_GymnopedieNo1.ino) and [H4P_TakeOnMe](../examples/MUSIC/H4P_TakeOnMe/H4P_TakeOnMe.ino) augmented to add LED light show.

Siren interface macros changed. See [Sirens](../examples/MUSIC/H4P_Sirens/H4P_Sirens.ino)

# Release Notes v3.1.1 24/06/2021

BUGFIX: LED_BUILTIN compile error on some ESP32 with non-standard LED board configurations

# Release Notes v3.1.0 13/06/2021

BUGFIX: A long-running WiFi reconnection problem on ESP32 is fixed. This was due to certain rare APs (mostly mobile phones acting as hotspots) producing events in an unusual order.

## Diagnostics

Most task and Q diagnostics have been move back into [H4](https://github.com/philbowles/H4). They are now compiled-out by default, saving about 9k in the size of the binary.
To enable them you need to edit `H4.h` in the [H4](https://github.com/philbowles/H4) library and set:

`#define H4_HOOK_TASKS     1`

CHANGED

Several plugins have been modified as a results of the changes in [H4](https://github.com/philbowles/H4) 3.1.0

* [H4P_SerialCmd](h4p.md) // h4/show/q unavailable unless `#define H4_HOOK_TASKS     1`
* :building_construction: [H4P_TaskSniffer](h4pxxxx.md) // unavailable unless `#define H4_HOOK_TASKS     1`
The declaration my be left in the code - it will still compile - it just won't do anything.

All of the [dignostics examples](../examples/03_DIAGNOSTICS) have been re-written
## Miscellaneous

CHANGED - code changes to prevent name clashes with other libraries  / even MORE excessive warnings in PIO (sheesh!)

`H4P_TimeKeeper`

DST_USA now H4P_DST_USA
DST_EU now H4P_DST_EU

`H4P_PinMachine`

template function `delegate` moved inside class and made static (prevents clash with e.g. SoftwareSerial)

Many thanks to Hamzah for these!



# Release Notes v3.0.8 10/06/2021

CHANGED - further enhancements to [H4P_Signaller](h4fc.md)

all API that take `h4pOutput*` now also take `h4pOutput&`
example sketch [Generic SQUAWK](../examples/XTRAS/H4P_Generic_SQUAWK/H4P_Generic_SQUAWK.ino modified to use new signaller features)

CHANGED - [H4P_WiFi](h4wifi.md) BUGFIX assigned wrong color to signal pin, optimised for new signaller features

DOCS - numerous fixes (thanks Hamza!)
# Release Notes v3.0.7 07/06/2021

CHANGED - enhancements to [H4P_Signaller](h4fc.md)

* `H4P_Signaller` now takes pin, sense, color for signal pin. If not specified, assumed values from [`config_plugins.h`](../src/config_plugins.h) are used
* `H4PE_SIGNAL` has been changed to expect a string containing a scheme (e.g. Morse or PWM and its associated parameters)
* a new `static` function `signal` is added to send `H4PE_SIGNAL` event with scheme M and its associated parameters

CHANGED - `H4P_HeapWarn` and  `H4P_QueueWarn`

Callback function removed. Users should instead listen for `H4PE_SYSWARN` events of "Heap,N" and "Q,N"

# Release Notes v3.0.6 03/06/2021

BUGFIX - error in H4P_ASSUMED_LED on ESP32

# Release Notes v3.0.5 03/06/2021

* New optional feature in `H4P_Heartbeat` takes mS parameter and "blips" `LED_BUILTIN` at that rate while WiFi is connected

Some lazy code omitting `std:`: prefixes has been corrected, but...

** KNOWN ERROR ** - you may get compile errors in the examples complaining about stdlib types `string`, `vector` etc being undefined - 
if so just insert the `std::` I'm working my way through them, but there's 80+ of them and I may have missed one or two.

# Release Notes v3.0.4 02/06/2021

* All "unsubscribe in onDisconnect" code removed from exmaples. Doh! 
* Some redundant APIs removed from `H4P_PinMachine`
* BUGFIX some type (uint32_t -> int where -ve can occur) on some  `H4P_PinMachine` functions
* BUGFIX: `H4P_RemoteUpdate` failing due to missing http:// prefix in some examples
* More doc files modified to add YT video links, more gaps filled...
# Release Notes v3.0.3 27/05/2021

* BUGFIX edge case in WiFi auto-reconnect
* H4P_Gatekeeper name changed to H4P_GateKeeper (for consistency with other naming)
* Unregulated YOUTUBE subfolder added to examples: convenience, they are not guaranteed - may not compile!
* Many doc files modified to add YT video links, some gaps filled...

# Release Notes v3.0.2 24/05/2021

* Minor emergency fix: totally erased device will not auto-start WiFi. (Tak, Peter!)
# Release Notes v3.0.1 23/05/2021

Minor fixes since major release 3.0.0

* `initial` value default set to OFF in h4pOutput see [GPIO Handling and "NODE-PINK" Introduction](nodepink.md)
* `mode` defaulted to `INPUT` and `sense` defaulted to `ACTIVE_HIGH`  in `h4pEncoder` / `h4pEncoderAuto`
* BUGFIX `pulsePin` had a bug where it would not correctly turn OFF the pin. see [H4P_Signaller](h4fc.md)
* various docs updated to add links to Youtube videos.
* continuing fixes / updates / additions to documentation: always check :door: [Documentation Master Index](docs/index.md) first

* New Event-driven programming model ("EDPM")
* Total overhaul of all GPIO / LED functions to mesh with "EDPM"."NODE-PINK" concept introduced
* WebUI enchancements
* New plugins in presence detection, remote HTTP
* new libraries added to install dependencies
